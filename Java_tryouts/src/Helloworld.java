// HelloWorld = name of the class, public = accessibility, defining a class
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("hello world!");// system.out as we want output from the system
    }// main is a method(function) and is an essential part of a java program, void = used when the method returns nothing, static = could be used in more than one instance and the values remain the same
    // String and args(argument) are the variables to be passed, in this case String[] is an array of strings
